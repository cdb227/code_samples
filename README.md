# Weather and Climate Data Analysis Sample Code

Welcome to my repository! This repository contains sample code showcasing techniques and methodologies for analyzing weather and climate data that I've developed for classes or research.

## About

This repository serves as a demonstration of my proficiency in handling weather and climate data, applying various data analysis techniques, and deriving meaningful insights. The sample code provided covers a range of topics, including data preprocessing, visualization, statistical analysis, machine learning, and more. I'll often use jupyter notebooks since they can show output inplace, allowing me to avoid finding a place to host larger processed datasets.

## Contents

- **Data Preprocessing**: Explore techniques for cleaning, filtering, and preparing weather and climate datasets for analysis.
- **Visualization**: Visualize weather and climate data using interactive plots, maps, and charts to uncover trends and patterns.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Apply statistical methods to analyze weather data, including descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and trend detection.
- **Machine Learning**: Demonstrate machine learning techniques for weather forecasting, climate modeling, and predictive analytics.
- **Examples**: Dive into real-world examples and case studies showcasing the application of data analysis techniques to weather and climate datasets.
