Welcome to my repository! This repository contains sample code showcasing techniques and methodologies for analyzing weather and climate data that I've developed for classes or research.

## About

This repository serves as a demonstration of my proficiency in handling weather and climate data, applying various data analysis techniques, and deriving meaningful insights. The sample code provided covers a range of topics, including data preprocessing, visualization, statistical analysis, machine learning, and more. I'll often use jupyter notebooks since they can show output inplace, allowing me to avoid finding a place to host larger processed datasets.

## Contents

- **Data Preprocessing**: Explore techniques for cleaning, filtering, and preparing weather and climate datasets for analysis.
- **Visualization**: More involved scripts for weather and climate data visualizations.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Apply statistical methods to analyze weather data, including descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and trend detection.
- **Machine Learning**: Demonstrate machine learning techniques for weather forecasting, climate modeling, and predictive analytics.
- **Numerical Methods**: Implement numerical algorithms for solving problems related to weather and climate analysis
  
_Note: There may be some overlap in each section as certain techniques and methodologies are applicable across multiple aspects of weather and climate data analysis._
